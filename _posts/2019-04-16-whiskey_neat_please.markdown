## Planning
Planning this project was a bit overwhelming as I was a bit behind on my labs in preparation for the Final Project.   As i work a full time job as an Operations Manager in an IT company, my day can be quite full and hectic.  It doesn't always allow or permit time to focus on homework or labs, but I try when I can!   It was duirng one of these lulls in the day when my team was talking in our Slack Channel, and someone posted a link for a Japanese Whiskey that has become very hard to get and has increased in price.   Many team members have traveled to Japan for our team, so this whiskey is well known amongst our team members.   The link posted was for Master of Malt located at: www.masterofmalt.com.  Upon looking at the website and being in a Flatiron haze of labs, I realized that this website lended itself nicely for Scraping.   I peaked at the HTML and declared victory as I had found my website!  Now all I had to do was figure out how to start the darn thing.  


## Starting
Starting was difficult.  I won't lie.  I generally knew what I wanted to accomplish.   My goals were simple to start off.   I wanted to scrape the website and get a list of whiskeys.   That was it.   A whiskey list was my main goal.   I thought if I could get the data from the website, then I could figure out the rest with code.   I knew the most basic function of my program would be to generate a numbered list to the user.  Get that working and you can build on that foundation.   

How do I do any of that?  Well, I sat down and reviewed the Final Project page and decided to watch the Avi video on how to set up your own CLI.   I've always found Avi videos to be extremely helpful.  He teaches in a way that is understandable and hearing his thought process out loud really helps you know whether your thinking is in the right direction.  It took me like 3 hours to actually watch Avi's 1 hour video.  I kept stopping and starting and adding to my program as he did his.   It was invaluable to get started.   


## Coding
Coding for me really began when I figured out the proper CSS commands to extract the data that I needed from the website.  This took quite a long time as I'm a noob and not exactly an expert at HTML parsing.  I spent a LONG time tinkering with commands and trying to figure out the best way to pinpoint the data I wanted to use.  I cant tell you how satisfying it was to finally create an Array of Hashes after scraping data from a website I chose.  It really empowers you to keep moving forward once that hurdle has been toppled.   I ended my first iteration of code with producing a list to the end user from scraped data.  At the time, I considered this a great achievement.  

Subsequent days and weeks were spent trying to get the base functionality working.   I had a working model and was very pleased with it when I realized that no where did I actually create or instantiate a new Object.  I was only dealing with data I scraped from a webpage and then added it to an Array.   The project requirements also state and point out that you should not be exclusively dealing with an Array of Hashes and that is exactly what I had coded.   Though I did have a working model, it needed an overhaul to implement Objects.

Subsequent days and weeks were spent on implementing Object logic.  Every time I had a working CLI/model, I'd make a change that had cacasding repercussions for other Methods.   It was great from a learning perspective, but rough from a time perspective.  I'm still in the phase where I will go down rabbit holes just to see what type of error I get or to see how the CLI responds.   I feel like I have to become familiar with what "wrong" looks like and I need to be able to anticipate cause/effect relationships with my code.   I want to understand what changing one section will do to the others.  


I began to realize that each level of code iteration I would write was really an extraction of what I had already coded.   Keep leveling up to make things leaner and cleaner.
