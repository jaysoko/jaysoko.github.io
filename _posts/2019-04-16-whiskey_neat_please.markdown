## Planning
Planning this project was a bit overwhelming as I was a bit behind on my labs in preparation for the Final Project.   As i work a full time job as an Operatiions Manager in an IT company, my day can be quite full and hectic.  It doesn't always allow or permit time to focus on homework or labs, but I try when I can!   It was duirng one of these lulls in the day when my team was talking in our Slack Channel, and someone posted a link for a Japanese Whiskey that has become very hard to get and has increased in price.   Many team members have traveled to Japan for our team, so this whiskey is well known amongst our team members.   The link posted was for Master of Malt located at: www.masterofmalt.com.  Upon looking at the website and being in a Flatiron haze of labs, I realized that this website lended itself nicely for Scraping.   I peaked at the HTML and declared victory as I had found my website!  Now all I had to do was figure out how to start the darn thing.  


## Starting
Starting was difficult.  I won't lie.  I generally knew what I wanted to accomplish.   My goals were simple to start off.   I wanted to scrape the website and get a list of whiskeys.   That was it.   A whiskey list was my main goal.   I thought if I could get the data from the website, then I could figure out the rest with code.   I knew the most basic function of my program would be to generate a numbered list to the user.    Get that working and you can build on that foundation.   

How do I do any of that?  Well, I sat down and reviewed the Final Project page and decided to watch the Avi video on how to set up your own CLI.   I've always found Avi videos to be extremely helpful.  He teaches in a way that is understandable and hearing his thought process out loud really helps you know whether your thinking is in the right direction.
